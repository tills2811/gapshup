            <p>This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information when You use the Service and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You.</p>
            <p>We use your personal data to provide and improve the services. By using the Service, You agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h5>1. Introduction</h5></div>
            <p>This Privacy Policy describes the manner in which we, Anisoft LLC. ("Anisoft"), use and protect your personal information that you provide, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your usage of our product Gapshup (“the Platform”). For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our’ refers to Gapshup, an Anisoft Company, and ‘you’ refers to you, the user of the Services.</p>
            <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h6>1.1 Privacy Principles</h6></div>
            <p>Gapshup has two basic and most important principles when it comes to collecting and processing of your private data:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="text-style">
              <p>(i) We do not use your data to show any ads or do not sell it to a third-party client.</p>
              </li>
              <li class=" text-style">
              <p>(ii) We only store the data that Gapshup needs to operate as a safe feature-rich messaging service and the content posted/shared by users in each of the groups.</p>
              </li>
              </ul>
            <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h6>1.2. Terms of Service</h6></div>
            <p>This Privacy Policy is a part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms and conditions under which you use our Platform, are available at <a href="https://gapshup.com/terms.html">https://gapshup.com/terms.html</a>. This Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.</p> 
            <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h5>2. Processing your personal information</h5></div>
            <p>We process your personal information on the basis that such processing is necessary to further our interests, including:<br> <ul>
              <li class="text-style">
              <p>(1) providing effective, secure and innovative services to our users; and</p></li>
           <li class=" text-style">
              <p>(2) to detect or prevent security issues in respect of our provision of services, unless those interests are overpowered by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.</p></li></ul>
            <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h5>3. What Personal Information We Use</h5></div>
             <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h6>3.1. Account Information</h6></div>
           
            <p>Gapshup is a social media platform. You provide your email id or phone number and basic account details (which may include profile name, full name) to create a Gapshup account. To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, your profile picture, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Gapshup are always public(unless you make it "private" in the Profile Settings). We do not want to know your gender, age or what you like.</p>
            <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h6>3.2. Messages</h6></div>
                       
            <ul>
              <li class="text-style"><p><strong class="font-weight-bold">(i). Chats:</strong> Chats in our Platform use end-to-end encryption. This means that all your data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient(recipients incase of a group chat) know. The encryption is done in order to protect your data against us and third parties from reading them and to learn what information is being shared in those chat messages.</p></li>
     <li class=" text-style"><p><strong class="font-weight-bold">(ii). Public, Private & Exclusive Group Posts/Chats:</strong> In addition to private messages, Gapshup also supports public, private and exclusive groups. All group chats are cloud chats. Like everything on Gapshup, the data you share in public community chats is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone. The private posts are visible only to the people within that group and the exclusive data is shared only within the people. Exclusive groups are hidden from public view and visible only to the members of the group.</p></li></ul>
     <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h6>3.3. Phone Number and Contacts</h6></div>
               <p>Gapshup uses phone numbers as unique identifiers/separators as part of your user profile. We ask your permission before syncing your contacts. We only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.</p>
           
            <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h5>4. Keeping Your Data Safe</h5></div>
              <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h6>4.1. Storing your Personal Data</h6></div>
            <p>If you registered for Gapshup from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the UK. These are third-party provided cloud storage exclusively for Gapshup. The cloud storage is completely encrypted during transit and at rest as these data can be images/video or media shared in groups/chats. As such, we do not share your personal data with such cloud providers.</p>
              <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h6>4.2. End-to-End Encrypted Data</h6></div>
            <p>Your messages, media and files from chats/groups, are all encrypted with key known to you and the recipient. While Gapshup servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the database.</p>
              <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h6>4.3. Data Retention</h6></div>
            <p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Platform.</p>
            
            <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h5>5. Processing Your Personal Data</h5></div>
              <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h6>5.1. Services</h6></div>
            <p>Gapshup is a social media platform service. We will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choice without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.</p>
              <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h6>5.2. Spam and Abuse</h6></div>
            <p>To prevent spam, cheating and other kinds of abuse and violations of Gapshup’s Terms of Service, our service moderators may check messages and posts that were reported to them by their recipients. If a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed valid by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting new users – temporarily or permanently and the respective posts or messages will be restricted. In case of more serious violations, your account may be banned and cannot be recovered.</p>
              
  
  <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h5>6. With Who are We Sharing Your Personal Data</h5></div>
              <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h6>6.1. Other Gapshup Users</h6></div>
            <p>Your personal information may be shared with other users of our Platform with whom you choose to communicate and share information with, who may be located outside the EEA. Please note that by accepting our Terms of Service and communicating with such other users of Gapshup, you command us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users, according to with this Privacy Policy. We employ the necessary methods to ensure that all the data being shared on your behalf is protected and is under no risk.</p>
              <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h6>6.2. Anisoft’s Companies</h6></div>
            <p>We may share your personal data with:</p>
